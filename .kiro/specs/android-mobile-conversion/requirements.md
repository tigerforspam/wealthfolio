# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves converting the existing Wealthfolio desktop application to Android using Tauri Mobile. Wealthfolio is a local-first investment tracking application built with React frontend and Rust backend using Tauri framework. The conversion will enable users to access their investment portfolio data on Android devices while maintaining the core functionality and local-first approach.

The conversion leverages Tauri's experimental mobile support to create a native Android application that shares the same codebase as the desktop version, ensuring consistency and reducing maintenance overhead.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Wealthfolio user, I want to install and run the application on my Android device, so that I can track my investments on mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user installs the Android APK THEN the application SHALL launch successfully on Android devices running API level 24 (Android 7.0) or higher
2. WHEN the application launches THEN it SHALL display the main portfolio dashboard with proper mobile-optimized layout
3. WHEN the user navigates through the app THEN all core screens SHALL be accessible and functional on mobile
4. WHEN the application is backgrounded and resumed THEN it SHALL maintain state and continue functioning properly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the application interface to be optimized for touch interaction and mobile screen sizes, so that I can easily navigate and use all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views any screen THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and properly scaled for mobile screen sizes (320px to 428px width)
2. WHEN the user interacts with buttons and controls THEN they SHALL be appropriately sized for touch interaction (minimum 44px touch targets)
3. WHEN the user navigates between screens THEN the navigation SHALL follow mobile UI patterns and be easily accessible
4. WHEN the user scrolls through lists or data THEN the scrolling SHALL be smooth and responsive
5. WHEN the user rotates the device THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately to landscape and portrait orientations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my investment data and functionality available on mobile, so that I have feature parity with the desktop version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses portfolio data THEN all investment accounts, holdings, and transactions SHALL be visible and accurate
2. WHEN the user adds new transactions THEN the mobile app SHALL support all transaction types available in desktop version
3. WHEN the user views charts and analytics THEN all financial charts SHALL render properly and be interactive on mobile
4. WHEN the user imports data THEN the mobile app SHALL support CSV import functionality
5. WHEN the user searches for assets THEN the search functionality SHALL work with proper mobile keyboard support

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to remain local and synchronized between desktop and mobile versions, so that I maintain privacy and data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates or modifies data on mobile THEN the SQLite database SHALL be updated locally on the device
2. WHEN the user has both desktop and mobile versions THEN they SHALL be able to manually sync data between devices
3. WHEN the application stores sensitive data THEN it SHALL use Android's secure storage mechanisms
4. WHEN the user uninstalls the app THEN they SHALL have the option to export their data first
5. IF the user reinstalls the app THEN they SHALL be able to import their previously exported data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the application to handle mobile-specific scenarios gracefully, so that I have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device has low memory THEN the application SHALL handle memory pressure gracefully without data loss
2. WHEN the device loses network connectivity THEN the application SHALL continue to function with local data
3. WHEN the device receives phone calls or notifications THEN the application SHALL properly handle interruptions
4. WHEN the device battery is low THEN the application SHALL minimize background processing
5. WHEN the application crashes THEN it SHALL recover gracefully and preserve user data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the mobile version to share maximum code with the desktop version, so that maintenance and feature development is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing mobile features THEN the Rust backend code SHALL be shared between desktop and mobile versions
2. WHEN adding new features THEN they SHALL be implemented once and work on both platforms
3. WHEN fixing bugs THEN the fixes SHALL apply to both desktop and mobile versions
4. WHEN the codebase is built THEN it SHALL produce both desktop and mobile artifacts from the same source
5. WHEN platform-specific code is needed THEN it SHALL be clearly isolated and documented

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install the mobile app directly via APK for personal use, so that I can use my investment tracker on mobile without app store dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mobile app is built THEN it SHALL produce a signed APK suitable for direct installation
2. WHEN the APK is installed THEN it SHALL include proper Android manifest with required permissions
3. WHEN the app requests permissions THEN it SHALL only request permissions necessary for functionality
4. WHEN the app is updated THEN a new APK SHALL be generated for manual installation
5. WHEN the app is installed THEN it SHALL appear properly in Android app drawer with correct icon and name

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the mobile app to integrate properly with Android system features, so that it feels native to the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria
